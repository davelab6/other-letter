Other Letter - A typeface combining the Sinhala and Tamil letters.
==================================================================


This project is not about solving the political problems in the country, but it is to explore the different graphical aspects of cultural boundaries between ethnicities in Sri Lanka and an attempt to dissolve these boundaries in a selected context.


Both the Sinhala and Tamil alphabets and writing systems were simplified and changed to accommodate the idea of hybrid letters. Basically this is a new writing system based on sinhala and tamil that could be easily learnt by the both ethnicities.
