Other-Letter
============

Other-Letter is a typeface combining the Sinhala and Tamil letters. 
This project is not about solving the political problems in the country, but it is to explore the different graphical 
aspects of cultural boundaries between ethnicities in Sri Lanka and an attempt to dissolve these boundaries in a 
selected context.
